Special mention here for my friend, [Tasos Kotharas](https://twitter.com/tasos_kotaras "Tasos Kotharas Twitter"), he took care of the app's AI and early versions UI. He achieved a very good balance of "smartness" to give the user a chance to win once in a while.

An interesting aspect of this project is how the sync functionality works with Dropbox, custom logos can be added in the gameplay without much hassle, making it a beautiful tool to showcase partners during corporate events.
