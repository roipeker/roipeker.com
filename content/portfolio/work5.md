This is ExploreIT, codename EIT, app made for CDW ◂ [StudioNorth](http://www.studionorth.com/ "StudioNorth website") in 2013.  <!--more-->

This app is an eternal beast. Is my first big project with SN. Overall, it was a real success for the studio, CDW and me. The project grew on a constant peace for over 2 years, with constant updates and improvements. The app is used to sell products from big partners companies and CDW services.

It runs on a huge touchscreen windows all-in-one, several Windows tablets, and iPads.

Built using **AS3 + AIR +** **barcode reader ANE.**

### The concept:

I'm not sure if I can remember all the bells & whistles about EIT, but it provides a comfortable way to guide and teach the user what are the solutions available for their needs... a CDW representative usually guides the attendees through the app, creating whiteboards with products schematics and notes. The app experience ends with a form, sending an email that collects all the information required for the specified solution.

### Features:

The app includes a list of special features like:

Scanning people's badges during the events for a fast "login", it does this via a bluetooth barcode scanner or through the device's camera (using an ANE to parse the PDF417 code).

There's a special feature, that has to be configured on the webadmin, to run a video-wall Screensaver, a special wall full of devices attached with magnets (that works as inductive chargers as well), that after a while of inactivity it runs a screensaver video as a whole, all devices in sync. This was a really challenging feature, as we had to rely on the wifi network speed. But the result was amazing... up to 29 devices playing a portion of a gigantic video in sync.

I will do my best to update this post with more information about this amazing app.
