This is ExploreIT, codename **EIT**, app made for CDW ◂ [StudioNorth](http://www.studionorth.com/ "StudioNorth website") in 2013.  <!--more-->

This app was a huge challenge. Is my first big project with SN.  
Overall, it was a real personal success, and for SN, CDW as well. The project grew on a constant rate for over 2 years, with tons of updates and improvements. The app is used to sell products from big CDW's partners companies and services.

It runs on touchscreen TVs & tablets (Windows) and iPads.

Built using **AS3 + AIR +** **barcode reader ANE.**

### The concept:

I'm not sure if I can remember all the bells & whistles about EIT, but it provides a comfortable way to guide and teach the user what are the solutions available for their needs.  
A CDW representative usually guides the event's attendees through the app, creating whiteboards with products schematics and notes. The app experience ends with a form, sending an email that collects all the information required for the specified solution, so the potential client and the company can stay in touch easily.

### Features:

The app includes several special features like:

Scanning people's badges during the events for a fast "login", it does this via a bluetooth barcode scanner or through the device's camera (using an ANE to parse the PDF417 code).

There's a special feature (that has to be configured on the webadmin side) to run a video-wall Screensaver; is like a wall full of devices attached with magnets (that works as inductive chargers as well), that after a while of inactivity, runs a screensaver video as a whole, all devices in sync. This was a really challenging feature, as we had to rely on the wifi network speed. But the result was amazing... up to 29 devices playing a portion of a gigantic video in sync in, the wall is around 3m long.

So, I will do my best to update this post with more information about this amazing app.
