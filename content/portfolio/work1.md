This app was develop for [Storyola](http://storyola.org/ "Storyola website") â—‚ [FastChicago](fastchicago.com "Fast Chicago website") in 2013.  
It's a storybook, for kids under 5.  
Built with AS3 + AIR + Genome2D framework, the client only requested an iPad version.

Apparently, it was taken down from the AppStore a while ago. So, I made a [screencast demo](https://vimeo.com/244091415 "5 Little Something' video demo") in Vimeo.

Enjoy!
