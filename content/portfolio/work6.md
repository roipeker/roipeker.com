**Healthtech Subscription** app was made for CDW ◂ [StudioNorth](https://www.studionorth.com/ "StudioNorth website") in 2015.

<!--more-->

This is a companion app, used in conjunction with other CDW apps via url schemas, as a fast and independent way to marketing and subscribe events' attendees to CDW news and mailing lists.

Built using **AS3 + AIR + Starling framework.**

Although the app looks (and is) pretty simple, I must admit making this screencast took me a while, and I'm starting to enjoy this video production thing!

Here's the [Window+iPad demo](https://vimeo.com/244156660 "Healthtech Subscribe Vimeo demo") on Vimeo. Enjoy !
