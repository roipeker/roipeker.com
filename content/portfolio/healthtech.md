App made for CDW ◂ [StudioNorth](http://www.studionorth.com/ "StudioNorth website") in 2015.

This is a basic form-companion app, used in conjunction with other CDW apps via url schemas, as a fast and independent way to marketing and subscribe events' attendees to CDW news and mailing lists.

Built using **AS3 + AIR +** [**Starling framework**](https://gamua.com/starling/ "Starling website")**.**

The special thing about this particular app is how it handles softkeyboard in both platforms. In order to improve the UX, mostly in Windows, I had to write a small C# program to read the status of the tabtip.exe process.

Here's the [Window+iPad demo](https://vimeo.com/244156660 "Healthtech Subscribe Vimeo demo") on Vimeo. Enjoy !

Although the app flow looks (and is) pretty simple, I must admit making this screencast took me a whiiiiile, but I'm starting to enjoy making videos.

So, more screencast demos coming this week! [Stay tuned](twitter.com/roipekr "roipeker Twitter profile")
